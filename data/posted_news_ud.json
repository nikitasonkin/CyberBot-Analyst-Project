Mike Fry, infrastructure data & security solutions director at Logicalis UK&I, says the lack of security resources is a major obstacle. Deploying MXDR to cover off the entire IT ecosystem is key to peace of mind and improving overall protection. MXDR hopes to be a solution to the problem of cybersecurity professionals hearing too many cries of ‘wolf!’ and being overwhelmed by information overload. It can be seen as 'just another tool' in a toolbox that’s already overwhelming an under-resourced IT department.",

        "summary": "A formal global body can scale prevention, investigation and disruption of cybercrime effectively. Shared legal definitions, harmonizing extradition laws and tackling digital poverty are essential foundations for an enforcement framework. Cybercrime is the one area in cybersecurity where global consensus is achievable, as most nations separate it from national security interests. Unlike cyberwarfare and nation-state attacks, which often trigger debates about national security, sovereignty and how to attribute responsibility, cybercrime offers a more clear-cut path to international cooperation.",

The event was hosted by the Center for the National Interest in partnership with George Mason University’s National Security Institute. The panelists discussed how the threat environment has changed, including the increasing role of generative AI, the challenges of attribution, and the sobering fact that many attacks go undetected for months, if not years. The discussion left the audience questioning, who is ultimately responsible when infrastructure fails: Is it the private sector's duty to defend itself, or must the federal government step in more forcefully?",

Ransomware attacks have become so widespread that 72% of all businesses were impacted by ransomware in 2023 alone. Unlike other types of outages, ransomware recovery presents several unique challenges and risks. It’s often not readily obvious which systems or data were impacted. Attackers may have compromised some servers or databases but not others. The environment that was compromised during a ransomware attack must remain unchanged while researchers analyze it to ensure that they mitigate the root cause.",

This report highlights a rarely-discussed but crucially important attack surface: security vendors themselves. When adversaries compromise a security company, they don’t just breach a single environment—they potentially gain insight into how thousands of environments and millions of endpoints are protected.",

Invoice fraud is also on the rise at the same time as these new scams are emerging. Members need to be alert as fraudsters use AI more often to generate these invoices, receipts, communications, and even payment confirmations. There are tools in development to counter this rising threat, but it remains unclear how effective they will be at detecting these false claims in isolation.",

Power cut halted transport services, shut down sections of industry, and left homes and public infrastructure without power for much of the afternoon. Energy authorities later confirmed that the outage originated from a sudden, sharp drop in electricity supply that destabilised the grid connection between Spain and France. Investigations are ongoing, but early reports suggest the instability may have been linked to atmospheric conditions that impacted transmission infrastructure, rather than deliberate interference or structural failure.",

Spain’s National Cybersecurity Office has previously denied any cyber attack behind the electricity outage in Spain. If it is proven that the blackout was directly caused by the cyberattack, it could be one of the biggest attacks on civilian sites in Europe. The expression “cutting off the electricity in some NATO countries” could mean that, if proven, the attack could be part of a larger vision targeting NATO countries.",

It seems likely there may be a link between them, but the extent of the attacks is yet to be seen.

At its core, ransomware persists not because of technological failures, but because it exploits fundamental economic misalignments between victims, service providers, and authorities. The ransom demands are bigger now and the stakes are higher. According to Coveware’s 2024 Q4 ransomware report, the average ransom payment reached $554,000, with 25% of victims choosing to pay the ransom. These payments have funded increasingly sophisticated criminal operations.",

        "summary": "Einstein’s equations implied the existence of extreme objects now known as black holes. But problematic aspects emerged and sparked a decades-long debate. Scientists have long been seeking a new paradigm, one in which the singularity is ‘healed’ by quantum effects that gravity must exhibit under such extreme conditions. This naturally leads to models of black holes without singularities, like those explored in the work of Stefano Liberati and his collaborators. The paper also describes how regular black holes and mimickers might form and how they could possibly transform into one another.",

Threat actors have leveraged disposable, dynamically generated domains to host payloads, often mimicking benign blog-related services to avoid suspicion. The new loader poses an increased risk of sensitive data theft and device compromise to targets due to its stealthy behavior.",

Bill is written by Senator Dick Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas. If this legislation becomes law, fraud and identity theft will increase and hurt our state economy. Most of Missouri’s seniors are one financial misstep away from financial catastrophe, says Mark O’Mara, president of MO Tax Relief Now. The best way to stay safe from fraud is to pay for things with a credit card.",

The Air Force already runs an initiative that helps place medically disqualified airmen into civilian roles within the Defense Department. For service members leaving the military after serving honorably, the bill would build on existing Navy transition programs.",

One executive order issued late in Biden’s term has especially important ramifications for GovCon cloud service providers and other technology contractors. Executive Order 14144 expanded the responsibilities of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, in handling federal cyber efforts. Trump, in his FY 2026 budget outline, proposed slashing CISA's budget by $491 million, or 17percent. The law and policy journal Just Security suggests the Trump administration has a few options: It may not address the order, it could scrutinize it for changes or it may simply wait for a more thorough review of cyber policy.",

As tensions grew, so did the physicality of the situation, with officers and lawmakers pushing and shouting at one another before Baraka was ultimately detained for several hours. DHS official suggested charges could be brought against the lawmakers and accused them of breaking into the facility, despite their legal authority to conduct oversight.",

Both bills represent significant steps toward modernizing Tonga's legal framework for the digital economy. They address critical areas of cybersecurity and electronic transactions in ways that generally align with international standards and practices. However, notable omissions in both bills include a lack of provisions addressing emerging digital technologies such as Web3, cryptocurrency, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI) As these technologies continue to gain global adoption and economic significance,. Tonga would benefit from incorporating specific provisions to accommodate them.",

About 45% of the time, hackers weren’t exploiting technical flaws, but instead human behavior, an investigation by Newsday found. The level of regularly updated cybersecurity prevention necessary to adequately protect school districts is “just not going to be feasible” economically.",

ECH accelerates the shift from an infrastructure-based security model to an application-layer approach. For enterprises, ECH significantly reduces network visibility, effectively preventing selective decryption of TLS traffic. It hinders security teams from detecting critical incidents, thereby increasing compliance risks and operational costs. The impact of ECH extends beyond individual organizations to the broader internet ecosystem.",

Centre of government’s grip on state of legacy IT systems is “unacceptable’, Public Accounts Committee says. MPs said a “significant gap” now exists between the magnitude of the cyber threat and government's response. Cyber-resilience levels not good enough to respond and recover effectively even if an incident is detected, MPs said. Cabinet Office believes “adversaries” are already using artificial intelligence to test government”s cyber defences.",

We fully expect new and possibly significant vulnerabilities to surface. That’s the point. Our goal is to offer and financially compensate researchers to coordinate their findings with vendors to expose this before bad actors take advantage. When the unknown becomes known, we all become more secure. We can’t do it alone: partners are essential. Collaboration is the future of security. Together, we're faster, smarter, and more resilient.",

By 2027, it could give malicious actors the tools to exploit system vulnerabilities faster than ever before.

The agency is calling on both private and public sector organisations to strengthen cyber resilience by embedding robust protections into all AI systems and their dependencies. The warning comes as the UK government officially classifies AI as a form of national infrastructure, along with energy, water and transport.",
