# Cyber NewsBot ‚Äì Automated News Pipeline

## Overview
`Cyber NewsBot` is a Python-based ETL system that **retrieves, filters, summarizes, and loads cyber news articles** into an MS SQL Server database, ready for professional data analysis.

The project demonstrates:
- Advanced use of Python (`pandas`, `sqlalchemy`)
- Automated ETL best practices
- Professional handling of news data (JSON ‚Üí SQL)
- Modular, production-ready code for scaling/automation


## Features
- üîé **Automated news retrieval** from RSS/Google Alerts
- üßπ **Duplicate filtering** (title, URL, `text_hash`)
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Smart summarization** & keyword extraction
- üíæ **Normalized SQL Server storage** (`PostedNews`, `SkippedNews`)
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Incremental load** (no duplicate keys)
- ‚è≤Ô∏è **Ready for scheduled automation (Task Scheduler, Airflow, etc.)**



## ETL Pipeline Steps
The main ETL logic is implemented in ([`src/to_sql.py`](src/to_sql.py).)

To run the script, execute:
```bash
python src/to_sql.py
```

### 1. **Extract** ‚Äì Collect news data from multiple JSON files
```python
import pandas as pd
posted_df = pd.read_json('posted_news_ud.json')
skipped_df = pd.read_json('skipped_news_ud.json')
```

### 2.Transform ‚Äì Filter out already-loaded records, clean and format data
```python
# Convert keywords to comma-separated string
posted_df['keywords'] = posted_df['keywords'].apply(lambda x: ','.join(x) if isinstance(x, list) else str(x))

# Remove records with duplicate text_hash
new_posted_df = posted_df[~posted_df['text_hash'].isin(existing_posted_hashes)].drop_duplicates(subset=['text_hash'])
```

### 3. Load ‚Äì Insert into SQL Server tables using SQLAlchemy
```python
new_posted_df.to_sql(
    "PostedNews",
    con=engine,
    if_exists="append",
    index=False,
    chunksize=1000
)
```

### Main Analysis Notebook

#### üìÑ File: `notebooks/Main_Analysis_Fina.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook represents the core analytical and AI-driven operations for processing and deriving insights from the data collected by the Cyber News Bot. The notebook is designed to perform comprehensive data cleaning, analysis, and visualization while also leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract deeper insights.

#### üîπ Key Objectives

1. **Data Retrieval and Processing**:
   - Establish a connection to the SQL database to fetch two main datasets:
     - `PostedNews`: Articles successfully published by the bot.
     - `SkippedNews`: Articles that failed and were not published.
   - Conduct initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to cleanse and understand the structure of both datasets.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - Standardize date and time fields for temporal analysis.
   - Remove duplicates and handle null values.
   - Generate auxiliary columns (e.g., day of the week, publication hour) to support further analysis.

3. **Embedding and Similarity Analysis**:
   - Use **Sentence Transformers** to create embeddings for article summaries:
     - Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text, enabling semantic understanding.
   - Perform **cosine similarity** calculations between embeddings:
     - Identify relationships between articles based on their content similarity.
     - Useful for clustering articles with similar topics or detecting duplicate or near-duplicate content.

4. **Keyword Analysis**:
   - Extract and clean keywords from articles, removing stopwords for clarity.
   - Aggregate and visualize the most frequently occurring keywords.
   - Generate a cleaned version of the keywords for improved relevance.

5. **Statistical Insights and Visualizations**:
   - Analyze trends in article publication and failures:
     - Daily trends for both published and skipped articles.
     - Breakdown of failure reasons (e.g., duplicates, invalid content).
   - Identify popular RSS sources contributing to the dataset.
   - Visualize the dataset using line graphs, pie charts, and comparison plots.

6. **Clustering and Machine Learning**:
   - Use **KMeans Clustering** to group articles based on their embeddings:
     - Helps categorize articles into thematic clusters.
   - Leverage TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Count Vectorization techniques to analyze textual patterns and relationships.

7. **SQL Integration and Data Management**:
   - Seamless integration with a SQL Server database using the `sqlalchemy` library.
   - Retrieve structured datasets directly into Pandas DataFrames.
   - Save processed or cleaned data back to the SQL database by creating new tables:
     - Example: Tables summarizing daily trends or keyword analyses can be written back to SQL for persistence.

#### üîπ Key Features and Analytical Steps

1. **Data Retrieval**:
   - The notebook connects to a SQL Server database using the `sqlalchemy` library.
   - Retrieves structured datasets (`PostedNews` and `SkippedNews`) for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform an initial review of both datasets:
     - Summarize key statistics (e.g., shape, null counts, duplicates).
     - Examine column types and unique values.
   - Generate random samples to inspect the quality and structure of the data.

3. **Embeddings and Similarity**:
   - **Embedding Creation**:
     - Use the `SentenceTransformer` model to compute embeddings for article summaries.
     - These embeddings encode the semantic meaning of text into high-dimensional vectors.
   - **Cosine Similarity**:
     - Measure the similarity between articles by calculating the cosine angle between their embeddings.
     - Applications include identifying duplicate articles, grouping similar topics, and detecting content overlap.

4. **Keyword Analysis**:
   - Analyze the `keywords` field for each article:
     - Clean and normalize keywords by removing common stopwords.
     - Explode keywords into individual rows for frequency analysis.
   - Generate a ranked list of the most frequently occurring keywords and visualize their distribution.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create detailed graphs and charts:
     - Line graph comparing published versus failed articles over time.
     - Pie chart highlighting the share of top keywords.
     - Daily breakdown of article submissions and failures.

6. **Clustering and Text Analysis**:
   - Use clustering techniques to group articles into thematic clusters:
     - Apply KMeans clustering on embedding vectors to identify content categories.
   - Employ TF-IDF and Count Vectorization to identify significant terms and patterns in article text.

7. **Failure Analysis**:
   - Analyze the reasons for article failures:
     - Categorize failures (e.g., duplicate titles, invalid content).
     - Visualize failure trends over time and by RSS source.
